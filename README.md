Steps done for this project 
1.Gather, wrangle, and tidy up data for movies reviews I can get data for
2.Train various natural language processing/machine learning models I can on the data
3.Use cross-validation techniques to tune hyper-parameters for each of the model 
4.Use the results of the model to see what model was best in predicting if the movie was good or bad. 


The files on the project files folder contains the data cleaning, exploritory analysis, and machine learning.
